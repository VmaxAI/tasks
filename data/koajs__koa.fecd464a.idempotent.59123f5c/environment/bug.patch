+     Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated
+     according to the following rules:
+    
+     1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
+     2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
+     3. Each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
+    
+     Note:
+     - A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
+     - Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
+     - Empty cells are represented by the character '.'.
