# Bug Report

### Describe the bug

When `sidebarFilePath` is explicitly set to `undefined` in the docs plugin configuration, the sidebars are not being autogenerated as expected. Instead, it seems like the plugin is not recognizing `undefined` as a valid value for triggering autogenerated sidebars.

### Reproduction

```js
// docusaurus.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs',
      {
        id: 'docs',
        path: 'docs',
        sidebarPath: undefined, // Explicitly set to undefined
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

### Expected behavior

When `sidebarPath` is set to `undefined`, the plugin should default to autogenerated sidebars. This was working in previous versions but now seems broken.

### System Info
- Docusaurus version: latest
- Node version: 18.x
