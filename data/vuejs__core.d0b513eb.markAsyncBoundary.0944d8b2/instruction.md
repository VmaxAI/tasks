# Bug Report

### Describe the bug

I'm experiencing an issue with `useId()` when used inside components with async boundaries (like `Suspense` or components with `serverPrefetch`). The generated IDs are not incrementing correctly, which causes ID collisions between sibling components.

### Reproduction

```js
// Parent component with Suspense
<Suspense>
  <AsyncComponent />
  <AsyncComponent />
  <AsyncComponent />
</Suspense>

// Inside AsyncComponent
const id1 = useId() // Expected: v-0-0, v-0-1, v-0-2
const id2 = useId() // Getting wrong increments
```

When multiple async components are rendered as siblings under a Suspense boundary, the IDs generated by `useId()` don't increment properly. It seems like the counter is being read before incrementing instead of incrementing first, leading to duplicate IDs or incorrect sequences.

### Expected behavior

Each call to `useId()` should generate a unique ID with properly incremented counters, even across async boundaries. The first component should get one set of IDs, the second component should get the next set, etc.

### System Info
- Vue version: 3.x
- Environment: SSR with async components
