# Bug Report

### Describe the bug

The default usage string generated by the command is not displaying correctly. When I have options defined but the help option is explicitly set to null, `[options]` still appears in the usage string. Similarly, when there's exactly one command, `[command]` is showing up in the usage even though it shouldn't.

### Reproduction

```js
const { Command } = require('commander');

// Case 1: Options with help disabled
const program1 = new Command();
program1
  .option('-d, --debug', 'enable debug')
  .helpOption(null);

console.log(program1.usage());
// Expected: '' or just the program name
// Actual: '[options]'

// Case 2: Single command
const program2 = new Command();
program2.command('serve');

console.log(program2.usage());
// Expected: '' (no [command] for single command)
// Actual: '[command]'
```

### Expected behavior

- When `helpOption(null)` is called to disable the help option, `[options]` should not appear in the usage string if there are no other options
- When there is only one subcommand registered, `[command]` should not be displayed in the usage string (it should only show for multiple commands)

### System Info
- commander version: latest
- Node.js version: 18.x
